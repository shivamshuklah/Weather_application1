Task 1: Flutter Weather App with API Integration
Description:
Develop a weather app using Flutter that displays weather information for a user's selected location. The app should retrieve weather data from a public weather API.

Requirements:

UI Design:
Main screen with a text input field for the city name.
Display temperature in degrees and other weather-related information with proper styling.
API Integration:
Integrate a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch weather data based on user input or device location.
Display fetched weather data on the main screen.
State Management:
Use Provider to manage the state of the app.
Bonus (Optional):

Implement a dynamic background based on current weather conditions.
Add error handling and user-friendly error messages for API request failures or location permission issues.
Submission:
Provide the source code for the Flutter weather app, along with instructions for running it and accessing the API key (if required). Share the code via a GitHub repository or another preferred format.
